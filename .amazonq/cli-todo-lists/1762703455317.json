Created performance test suite in __tests__/performance/performance.test.js to validate command recognition speed, caching efficiency, and overall performance improvements. Phase 2 improvements are now complete with significant performance optimizations implemented."],"modified_files":["/home/admin/000code/terMinal/core/CommandRecognizer.js","/home/admin/000code/terMinal/cache/ResponseCache.js","/home/admin/000code/terMinal/core/ServiceContainer.js","/home/admin/000code/terMinal/state/StateManager.js","/home/admin/000code/terMinal/command_executor.js","/home/admin/000code/terMinal/monitoring/PerformanceMonitor.js","/home/admin/000code/terMinal/main.js","/home/admin/000code/terMinal/utils/ErrorBoundary.js","/home/admin/000code/terMinal/__tests__/performance/performance.test.js"],"id":"1762703455317"}
